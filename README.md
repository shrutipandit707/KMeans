# Unsupervised K-Means Clustering for Online Retail Data
> In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using Unsupervised Clustering K-Means techniques. Online retail is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
